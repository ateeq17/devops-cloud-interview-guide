## Question  
Explain the Git branching strategy you used in your company. Align it with the open-source branching strategy followed by Kubernetes.

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question explores how you organize your Git workflow in a collaborative environment — especially in large codebases. Kubernetes, like many open-source projects, uses a clean and scalable branching strategy.

## ✅ Answer  
In my company, we followed a well-structured Git branching model similar to the Kubernetes project's workflow. Our strategy centered around four key branches:

- `main` – the default and stable development branch  
- `feature/*` – for all new features and enhancements  
- `release/*` – for preparing and testing production releases  
- `hotfix/*` – for urgent bug fixes or patches to production

main
The default branch representing stable code.
Always deployable and protected with CI/CD checks.
Only accepts merges from tested release/* or urgent hotfix/* branches.

feature/*
Used for developing new features or enhancements.
Each feature branch is short-lived and tied to a specific task or story.
Developers open pull requests to merge into main once peer-reviewed and tested.

release/*
Created when preparing for a production release.
Serves as a staging area for final testing, bug fixes, and documentation updates.
Once validated, merged into main and tagged for deployment.

hotfix/*
Reserved for urgent patches to production.
Enables rapid response to critical issues without disrupting ongoing development.
After resolution, merged back into both main and relevant release/* branches to maintain consistency.



This helped us maintain stability while enabling parallel development and quick recovery from issues.

### 📘 Detailed Explanation  

#### 🔹 `main` branch
- Equivalent to `master` or `main` in Kubernetes.
- Represents the **latest development state** — stable but evolving.
- All feature branches are branched off from here.
- Protected with branch rules and mandatory code reviews.

> Developers do not commit directly to `main`. All changes go through pull requests.

---

#### 🔹 `feature/*` branches
- Used for individual features or enhancements.
- Named like `feature/login-api` or `feature/cleanup-metrics`.
- Created from `main`.
- Developers work independently and raise PRs when done.

> We squash commits before merging to keep the history clean.

---

#### 🔹 `release/*` branches
- Cut from `main` when preparing for a release, e.g., `release/1.4`.
- Only allows **bug fixes, performance improvements, and docs**.
- CI pipelines run regression tests and validations here.
- Used for staging deployments and QA approvals.

> Kubernetes also creates release branches (e.g., `release-1.28`) to stabilize features after code freeze.

---

#### 🔹 `hotfix/*` branches
- Created from the latest release tag or `main`, based on urgency.
- Used when we need to fix critical bugs directly on production without waiting for the next release cycle.
- After fixing and testing, changes are merged back to both `main` and the relevant `release/*` branch.

> This ensures the fix is available in both the short term and future releases.

---

### ✅ Benefits of this Strategy:
- Supports **parallel development** and **safe releases**
- Keeps `main` clean and always deployable
- Makes it easy to trace features and bug fixes
- Aligns well with CI/CD automation and changelog generation

---

> By following this branching strategy, we maintained agility without compromising stability — which is critical in both enterprise and open-source scale environments like Kubernetes.
